# Likes and Dislikes

## Kotlin

### Likes

* Extension methods
* `when` operator
* Getters/setters
* Default placeholder name _
* ? and ?:
* Inline formatting "Name: $name"
* `var/val` is much more convenient then actual type names
* One line functions like `fun getSomething() = something`
* Built-in helper functions like `sumBy`, `firstOrNull`, etc

### Dislikes

* no replacement for `static final`. I cannot always use `const`, because it requires a constant, not expression
* ternary operaton. I think it looks better in Java
