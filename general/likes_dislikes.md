# Likes and Dislikes

## Kotlin

### Likes

* Extension methods
* `forEach` method
* `when` operator
* Getters/setters
* Placeholder names

### Dislikes

* no replacement for `static final`. I cannot always use `const`, because it requires a constant, not expression
* ternary operaton. I think it looks better in Java
